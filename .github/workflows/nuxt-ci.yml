# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Continuous Integration

# Controls when the action will run. 
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  # Disabled branches doesn't exist (it doesn't exist a native way to disable a workflow so this is reason why this trick is used)

    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
